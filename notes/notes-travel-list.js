/*
n this project we write the components inside the App.js file but since we are beginner we write it like this and later we will have a different file for every component we need


State VS props
State:
1. Internal data, owned by component 
2. Component "memory"
3. Can be updated by the component itself
4. Updating state casuses component to re-render
5. Used to make components interactive

Props:
1. External data, owned by parent component
2. Similar to function parameters 
3. Read-only
4. receiving new props causes component to re-render usually when the parent's state has been updated
5. Used by parent to configure child component ("Settings")



Three steps to do the steps project:
1. Define the state variable
2. Use the state variable
3. Update the state variable
