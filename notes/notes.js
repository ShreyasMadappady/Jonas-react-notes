/*
before the react version 18 they were render the root like this :

 React.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root")

JSX is combined the CSS , HTML and JavaScript codes all together


we can use the arrow functions in react like this:
const test = () => {}


in react we must keep a simple rule for all the functions:

1. the function must start with a capital letter
2. the function must return a make up


Components in react contains the Data, Logic and Appearance all together 


lets talk about the Declartive and Imperative type of codes:

Imperative :
  1. Manual DOM element selection and DOM traversing
  2. Step by step DOM mulations until we reach the desired UI
  HINT: it's about how to do things

Declarative;
  1. Describe what UI should look like using JSX based on current data 
  2. React is an abstraction away from DOM: we never touch the DOM
  3. Instead we think of the UI as a reflection of the current data
  HINT: its about what we want
