/*
* Where To Create Side Effects:
@ - Review;
A side effect is basically any "interaction between a React component and the world outside the component" . We can also think of a side as "code that actually does something". Examples: Data fetching, setting up subscriptions, setting up timers, manually accessing to the DOM , etc.

@ - We need side effects all the time. They make our application do something. NOT in render logic!

++ We can create side effects in two different places in React;
1 - Event handlers => functions that are triggered whenever that the event that they are listening to happens.
! Triggered by events (onClick,onSubmit,etc.)
++ Sometimes this is not enough for the application's needs

2 - Effects (useEffect) => Effects allow us to write code that will run at different moments: mount,re-render,or unmount.
! Triggered by rendering


* Event handlers VS. Effects:
@ When?

++ Event handlers : 
- Executed when the corresponding event happens
! Preffered way to creating side effects

++ Effects: 
- Executed after the component mounts (initial render) and after subsequent re-renders (according to dependency array).

- Used to keep a component synchronized with some external system (in this example, with the API movie data).

! These two will produce the same result,but at different moments.



* Whats the useEffect dependency array?
@ - By default, effects run after every render. We can prevent that by passing a dependency array

@ - Without the dependency array, React doesn't know when to run the effect

@ - Each time one of dependencies changes , the effect will be executed again

@ - Every state variable and prop used inside the effect MUST be included in the dependency array
! Otherwise we get a "stale closure". We will go more into depth in a future section ðŸ‘‰ 



* useEffect is a synchronization mechanism:
@ - The mechanics of effects: 
- useEffect is like an event listener that is listening for one dependency to change.Whenever a dependency changes,it will execute the effect again!


- Effects react to updates to state and props used inside the effect (the dependencies). So effects are "reactive" (like state updates re-rendering the UI)

++ title change / userRating changes => effect is executed again => document title is updated

? Component state/ props => synchronize with => Exterrnal system (side effect)

* Synchronization and lifecycle:
@ - Dependency (state or props) changes => Effect is executed again and Component is re-redered 
! Effects and component lifecycle are deeply connected

- We can use the dependency array to run effects when the component renders or re-renders
 
some examples for dependency array:

@ - useEffect(fn, [x,y,z])
* Synchronization => Effect synchronizes with x,y,z
++ Lifecycle => Runs on mount and re-renders triggered by updating x,y or z

@ - useEffect(fn,[]) 
* Synchronization => Effect synchronizes with no state / props
++ Lifecycle => Runs only on mount (initial render)

@ - useEffect(fn)
* Synchronization => Effect synchronizes with everything
++ Lifecycle => Runs on every render (usually badâ›”)

Update news of the course progress => today im sick and cant work properly
